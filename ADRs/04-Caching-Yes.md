## Title

To Cache or Not to Cache

## Context

MonitorMe demands high responsiveness that could be aided by the use of a cache.

## Decision

Cache will be used as the data store for retrieving single-point readings. A cache key such as PatientId_BloodPressure could contain the latest reading along with its state. Leveraging cache can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the system by reducing the need for frequent database queries and computations. This approach aligns with our goal of optimizing performance while handling live monitoring data.

## Consequences, Trade-Offs, and Impacts

By incorporating caching into the architecture, we can expect improved response times and reduced load on the database. However, this decision also introduces complexity in cache management and synchronization, requiring careful monitoring and maintenance to ensure data consistency and integrity. Additionally, caching may introduce overhead and potential inconsistencies if not implemented and managed properly. Despite these challenges, we believe that the benefits of caching outweigh the associated trade-offs and impacts, ultimately enhancing the overall performance and scalability of MonitorMe.
