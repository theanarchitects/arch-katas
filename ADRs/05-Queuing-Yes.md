## Title

On the Use of Queues

## Context

Determining whether to use queues or not significantly impacts the system's ability to handle incoming data streams, process them efficiently, and ensure timely delivery to caregivers.

## Decision

We concluded that using queues helps decouple different parts of the system, enabling asynchronous communication and better handling of peak loads. By utilizing queues, we can enhance the system's fault tolerance, mitigate bottlenecks, and improve overall performance.

## Consequences, Trade-Offs, and Impacts

Effective queue management requires addressing factors like message ordering, processing time, and queue capacity. Despite challenges like potential points of failure and latency issues, we believe the benefits of queue usage such as improved reliability and scalability make up for the trade-offs. Strategic queue integration enhances MonitorMe's infrastructure, ensuring enhanced reliability, scalability, and responsiveness.
