Decision on Service Architecture for Vital Signs Handling

## Context

Having a dedicated service for each vital sign allows us to tailor thresholds and alerting criteria for individual parameters, optimizing for speed. Conversely, employing a generic vital sign service with configurable settings enhances reusability and simplifies maintenance processes.

## Decision

After careful consideration, we have decided to implement a generic service capable of handling all vital signs within MonitorMe. This approach enhances longevity by providing a flexible framework that can adapt to future changes and additions to vital sign monitoring requirements. Additionally, consolidating vital sign handling into a single service streamlines management efforts, and simplifies system maintenance.

## Consequences, Trade-Offs, and Impacts

While opting for a generic service offers benefits in terms of longevity and ease of management, it may introduce complexity in service design and implementation. Ensuring that the generic service can effectively handle various vital signs while maintaining performance and reliability requires careful planning and testing. Additionally, consolidating all vital sign handling into a single service may increase the risk of bottlenecks and dependencies, necessitating robust monitoring and fault-tolerance mechanisms.

However, we believe that the simplicity of using a generic service trumps the complexity involved in multiple services. By implementing a flexible and centralized approach to vital sign handling, MonitorMe can better adapt to evolving requirements, streamline management efforts, and ensure long-term sustainability.
