## Requirements

#### Data Acquisition:

The system must read data from 8 different patient-monitoring equipment, including heart rate, blood pressure (BP), oxygen level (O2), blood sugar, respiration rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, and sleep status (sleep or awake).

#### Data Transmission:

Data must be transmitted to a consolidated monitoring screen (one per nurse's station).

#### Responsiveness:

Achieve an average response time of 1 second or less, ensuring vital signs are available on the screen within 1 second of data emission.

#### Display Rotation:

The monitoring screen should display each patient’s vital signs, rotating between patients every 5 seconds.

#### Patient Limit:

The system should support a maximum of 20 patients per nurse's station.

#### Data Storage:

Store the past 24 hours of all vital sign readings.

#### Alerting Mechanism:

Analyze each patient’s vital signs and alert if issues are detected, such as oxygen drops or temperature exceeding a preset threshold. The trend and threshold analysis may depend on sleep vs. awake status. Medical professionals receive alerts via a mobile app or on the monitoring screen.

#### Fault Tolerance:

In case of any vital sign device failure, the system should ensure continued monitoring of the other feeds.

#### Data Export:

The system should enable export of consolidated snapshots to MyMedicalData through a secure HTTP API.

#### Data Frequency:

- HR: Capture heart rate data every 500ms.
- BP: Capture blood pressure data every hour.
- O2: Capture oxygen level data every 5 seconds.
- Blood sugar: Capture blood sugar data every 2 minutes.
- Respiration: Capture respiration rate data every second.
- ECG: Capture electrocardiogram data every second.
- Body temp: Capture body temperature data every 5 minutes.
- Sleep status: Capture sleep status data every 2 minutes.

#### Deployment:

Deploy as an on-premises solution with a maximum of 500 patients per installation.

#### Compliance:

No specific compliance requirements are specified.

These requirements outline the functionality and performance expectations for the MonitorMe solution.
